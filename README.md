Jamhacks 2023 üçá - Machine learning using python OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Streamlit UI

* Utilized Mediapipe and OpenCV to precisely track finger positions in the human hand
* Trained the system to recognize hand gestures, enabling next-generation shortcuts and intuitive interaction. 

Using this program, developers can create gestures to trigger actions and control applications, opening up the potential for shortcuts for efficient notetaking and eliminating the need for drawing tablets.
